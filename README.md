# Obstacle_detection
Evaluation for 2D lidar
Exploratory Data Aanalysis in Python
This project evaluates the performance of 2D solide state lidar to help drivers avoid collisions with vulnerable users and other obstacles.

# Static scenarios
The static scenarios studied aim to examine the effectiveness of lidar in detecting a pedestrian and a traffic cone statically. This experiment was carried out in the indoor parking lot at Polytechnique Montr√©al for 25 minutes

# Dynamic scenarios 
We collected data by circulating in dangerous zones in the city of Montreal. Two experiments were carried out in the center of the island of Montreal in winter. The first experience lasted more than 2 hours at the end of the week. The second experiment lasted more than 3 hours in the middle of the week.
